Features
--------

Provide additional information to result of Live Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The result of the live search now contains additional information from the fields:

- Date
- Teaser
- Author
- Slug

This makes it easier to find the correct record.

Improved suggest wizards in FlexForms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The suggest wizards in FlexForms now skip pages that are not reachable.
The selection of a page for the detail view ignores doktypes like sysfolder.

This makes the life of editors easier - especially on bigger instances.

Tagged Data Processors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The usage of the data processors has been simplified by using their tags.

   .. code-block:: typoscript

      # old
      10 = GeorgRinger\News\DataProcessing\AddNewsToMenuProcessor
      20 = GeorgRinger\News\DataProcessing\DisableLanguageMenuProcessor
      new
      10 = add-news-to-menu
      20 = disable-language-menu


Site Set Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The extension now supports site sets as drop in replacements for TypoScript includes.

*TYPO3 13 only*

Flag topnews records in backend list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a record is marked as topnews, it is now highlighted in the backend list
with a small blue border on the left side.

*TYPO3 13 only*


Add StatusInformation to pages with news
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a page contains a news plugin, a small icon is shown in the page tree to indicate this.

This feature is *TYPO3 13 only* and can be disabled in the global extension settings.
